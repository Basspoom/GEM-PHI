## Description

The **GEM-PHI (Graph-Embedded Multimodal learning for Phage-Host Interaction)** pipeline is a comprehensive toolkit for predicting phage-host relationships. It leverages a *Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT)* model to integrate various genomic features, including nucleotide embeddings, protein-based features, and homology information, to provide accurate predictions of which phages infect which hosts. The pipeline is designed to be modular and efficient, handling large-scale genomic datasets by first calculating node and edge features in dedicated environments, then performing final inference to output a list of predicted interactions.




## Installation


### Clone the source code

```bash
git clone git@202.38.92.250:source-code/gem-phi.git
cd gem-phi
```


### Create the conda environment

The GEM-PHI pipeline uses three separate Conda environments for its different stages to manage dependencies effectively. The `environment` files are located in the environments directory.

```bash
conda env create -f environments/GEM-PHI.yml -n GEM-PHI_inference
conda env create -f environments/GEM-PHI_nodes.yml -n GEM-PHI_nodes
conda env create -f environments/GEM-PHI_edges.yml -n GEM-PHI_edges
```




### Prepare the pre-trained models

The pipeline requires several pre-trained models and external tools. You need to download them and update their paths in the config.yml file.

1. **Nucleotide Transformer Model**: Used for calculating nucleotide embeddings.
2. **RBP Detection Model**: Used to predict receptor-binding proteins in phages.
3. **Protein Embedding Model**: Used to calculate embeddings for the predicted RBPs.
4. **CRISPRCasFinder**: An external tool used for identifying CRISPR arrays and spacers in host genomes.

> The paths in your `config.yml` should be set to the corresponding locations within the `tools/` directory, similar to the following:
> ```yml
> paths:
>    nt_model_dir: 'tools/NT-500M'
>    rbp_detect_model_dir: 'tools/RBPdetect_v4_ESMfine'
>    rbp_embed_model_dir: 'tools/BiooBang/Bioobang1.0'
>    ccf_script: 'tools/CRISPRCasFinder/CRISPRCasFinder.pl'
>    ccf_so: 'tools/CRISPRCasFinder/sel392v2.so'
> ```




### Prepare the database

The pipeline uses reference databases for calculating certain features. You can download the required databases from our Zenodo repository.

1. **HGT Model Files**: The pre-trained HGT model, including the graph structure, node ID mappings, and normalization statistics.
2. **Reference Nodes**: A pickled file containing pre-calculated node features for a reference set of phages and hosts.
3. **Reference 16S rRNA**: A FASTA file containing 16S rRNA sequences for the reference hosts, used for phylogenetic similarity calculation.

> You can download the databases from our Zenodo link and set the `ref_nodes_file` and `ref_16s_file` paths in your `config.yml` file
> ```yml
> paths:
>    stats_path: '/your/path/to/GEM-PHI/db/graph/norm_stats_combined.pt'
>    graph_path: '/your/path/to/GEM-PHI/db/graph/Train_hetero.pt'
>    id_map_path: '/your/path/to/GEM-PHI/db/graph/id_maps.pt'
>
>    ref_nodes_file: '/your/path/to/GEM-PHI/db/reference_nodes.pkl'
>    ref_16s_file: '/your/path/to/GEM-PHI/db/reference_16s.fasta'
> ```




## Quick Start

The GEM-PHI pipeline consists of three main scripts for feature calculation and one script for orchestration. All scripts are located in the `bin/` directory.

1. `calculate_node_features.py`: This script is the first step of the pipeline. It takes host and phage FASTA files as input and computes a variety of node-level features, including GC content, k-mer frequency, nucleotide transformer embeddings, and RBP embeddings for phages. This script must be run in the `GEM-PHI_nodes` Conda environment.

2. `calculate_edge_features.py`: The second step, this script calculates features for the edges connecting the nodes. It computes phage-phage, host-host, and phage-host edge features based on similarities and homologies. This script must be run in the `GEM-PHI_edges` Conda environment.

3. `final_inference.py`: This is the final step, which loads the pre-trained GEM-PHI model and the calculated node and edge features to predict phage-host interactions. The script outputs a list of predicted interactions and their confidence scores. This script must be run in the `GEM-PHI_inference` Conda environment.

For a complete and automated run of the entire pipeline, use the `run_all.py` script. It orchestrates the execution of the three sub-scripts in their respective Conda environments.
